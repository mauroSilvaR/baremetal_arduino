# SIMPLE GPIO IN ATMEGA328P
The project was build to be used on the simple arduino nano and its goal is to present simple bit atomic operations with 8-bit registers

In this first section we are just going to set pins as outputs or inputs and control their behaviour with predefined macros to manipulate the registers.

# INSTALL
The code is a simple arduino file (.ino) so just open your arduino and open this project and it should work right out of the box. Alternatively you can just copy and paste this into your new project and start a new project on the arduino IDE. The IDE already has all the built in steps necessary for compilation on the ATMEGA 328P
